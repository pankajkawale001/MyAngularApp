-- Angular Life Cycle hooks

1. ngOnChanges - When the value of an input binding to the component changes, this hook is called.
2. ngOnInit - Once the component has been initialized and its input bindings have been handled, this hook is invoked.
3. ngDoCheck -Every change detection cycle ends with a call to this hook. Because of the performance ramifications, it is frequently regarded as an anti-pattern.
4. ngAfterContentInit -After the projected content (content projected into the component with <ng-content>) has been initialized, this hook is invoked.
5. ngAfterContentChecked -This hook is invoked at the end of each change detection cycle for the projected content.
6. ngAfterViewInit - After the component's view (including its children) has been fully initialized, this hook is called.
7. ngAfterViewChecked -This hook is invoked at the end of each change detection cycle for the component's view.
8. ngOnDestroy- When the component is destroyed, this hook is called.
